# Sentiment and Emotion Analysis
This repository provides Python code and resources for performing Sentiment and Emotion Analysis, both with and without using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. Sentiment and Emotion Analysis are essential tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involve determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and emotion (e.g., happy, sad, angry) expressed in a given text.

# Features
1. Sentiment Analysis: The repository contains implementations of sentiment analysis using different techniques, including:
   
        --Traditional Machine Learning approaches (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines).
  
        --Deep Learning methods (e.g., LSTM, Transformer-based models).

3. Emotion Analysis: Emotion analysis is achieved through:
   
       --Rule-based methods using lexicons.
  
       --Supervised learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.

4. With NLTK: Demonstrates how to perform Sentiment and Emotion Analysis using the popular Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library.

5. Without NLTK: Provides alternative methods that do not rely on the NLTK library for Sentiment and Emotion Analysis.
